# NIST Framework Summary

## 📌 Overview
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 and the Risk Management Framework (RMF) provide structured methodologies for managing cybersecurity risks. These frameworks ensure that organizations like ShopSmart Solutions can detect, respond to, and mitigate threats effectively.

## 📌 1️⃣ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

### 🔹 Key Functions:
The NIST CSF is divided into five core functions, which act as pillars of a strong cybersecurity program:

| Function   | Description |
|---------------|----------------|
| Identify  | Understand business assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.   |
| Protect   | Implement safeguards to prevent cybersecurity incidents.  |
| Detect    | Continuously monitor systems to identify threats.         |
| Respond   | Develop incident response plans and mitigation strategies |
| Recover   | Ensure system restoration and resilience after an attack. |

### 🔹 How CSF Helps Our Project
- Defines risk management processes for real-time threat detection.
- Guides the development of security policies for ShopSmart Solutions.
- Helps in prioritizing cybersecurity risks through threat intelligence.

## 📌 2️⃣ NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

### 🔹 Key Steps of RMF:
The NIST SP 800-37 (Risk Management Framework - RMF) outlines a six-step risk assessment process:

| Step | Description |
|----------|----------------|
| Categorize | Identify and classify information systems based on risk.       |
| Select     | Choose appropriate security controls (e.g., encryption, MFA).  |
| Implement  | Deploy security measures to protect data and services.         |
| Assess     | Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of security controls.  |
| Authorize  | Approve the system based on risk assessment.                   |
| Monitor    | Track and manage risks on an ongoing basis.                    |

### 🔹 How RMF Helps Our Project
- Ensures compliance with cybersecurity best practices.
- Helps us design risk mitigation strategies aligned with NIST standards.
- Provides a structured approach to security assessments for OSINT integrations.
