📌 2️⃣ OSINT Tool Integration in Our Project

🔹 Shodan (Network & Asset Security)

✅ Purpose:

Detects exposed services, open ports, and misconfigured devices.

Identifies vulnerable IoT devices and critical security risks.

✅ Integration Plan:

Implement Node.js backend API to fetch vulnerability data from Shodan.

Store scan results in PostgreSQL for historical tracking and risk analysis.

Trigger real-time alerts when high-risk assets are detected.

✅ Example API Call:

curl -X GET "https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/8.8.8.8?key=YOUR_API_KEY"

🔹 SecurityTrails (Domain & IP Intelligence)

✅ Purpose:

Provides historical DNS, WHOIS, and IP intelligence for domains.

Detects newly registered domains, subdomains, and security risks.

✅ Integration Plan:

Implement SecurityTrails API to fetch domain and IP metadata.

Store insights in PostgreSQL for risk analysis.

Display risk assessment in React.js dashboard.

✅ Example API Call:

curl -X GET "https://api.securitytrails.com/v1/domain/example.com" -H "APIKEY: YOUR_API_KEY"

🔹 Hunter.io (Email Intelligence)

✅ Purpose:

Finds professional email addresses associated with a domain.

Helps track down potential phishing and malicious domains.

✅ Integration Plan:

Use Hunter.io API to fetch email addresses from a domain.

Store results in PostgreSQL and analyze domain credibility.

Provide warnings for suspected phishing attempts.

✅ Example API Call:

curl -X GET "https://api.hunter.io/v2/domain-search?domain=example.com&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"

📌 3️⃣ OSINT API Data Flow in Our System

How OSINT Tools Fit Into Our Real-Time Threat Intelligence System

1️⃣ User Queries Threat Intelligence System

Users search for an IP, domain, or email in the React.js dashboard.

2️⃣ Back-End Requests OSINT Data

The Node.js API calls Shodan, SecurityTrails, and Hunter.io APIs.

3️⃣ Data Storage & Risk Analysis

API responses are stored in PostgreSQL for tracking.

AI-based risk scoring is applied to evaluate threats.

4️⃣ Threat Intelligence Dashboard Updates

Users see live threat intelligence insights in the dashboard.

System triggers alerts for critical security threats.

📌 4️⃣ Benefits of OSINT Integration

✅ Proactive Threat Detection – Detects security risks before an attack happens.✅ Automated Security Monitoring – Real-time OSINT feeds provide continuous risk assessment.✅ Enhances Incident Response – Helps prioritize security actions based on risk scoring.✅ Improves Compliance – Aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and Risk Management Framework (RMF).

📌 5️⃣ Conclusion

By integrating Shodan, SecurityTrails, and Hunter.io, we enable real-time cybersecurity monitoring for ShopSmart Solutions. These tools help in identifying network vulnerabilities, monitoring domain risks, and tracking phishing emails, ensuring a robust risk management framework.
