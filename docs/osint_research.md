## 📌 2️⃣ OSINT Tool Integration in Our Project  

### *🔹 Shodan (Network & Asset Security)*
✅ *Purpose:*  
- Detects *exposed services, open ports, and misconfigured devices*.  
- Identifies *vulnerable IoT devices* and *critical security risks*.  

✅ *Integration Plan:*  
- Implement *Node.js backend API* to fetch vulnerability data from *Shodan*.  
- Store scan results in *PostgreSQL* for historical tracking and risk analysis.  
- Trigger *real-time alerts* when high-risk assets are detected.  

✅ *Example API Call:*
bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/8.8.8.8?key=YOUR_API_KEY"


---

### *🔹 Have I Been Pwned (Credential Security)*
✅ *Purpose:*  
- Checks if *email addresses, usernames, or passwords* have been compromised in known data breaches.  

✅ *Integration Plan:*  
- Implement *email and password security checks* in our authentication module.  
- Alert users if their credentials are found in the *HIBP database*.  
- Use *GPT-4 AI* to provide *automated risk recommendations*.  

✅ *Example API Call:*
bash
curl -H "hibp-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" "https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/example@example.com"


---

### *🔹 VirusTotal (Malware & Domain Reputation)*
✅ *Purpose:*  
- Scans *files, URLs, and IP addresses* for malware threats.  
- Provides *real-time risk scores* based on multiple security vendors.  

✅ *Integration Plan:*  
- Use VirusTotal API to *analyze suspicious files, domains, and URLs* before processing transactions.  
- Display *risk assessment scores* on the *React.js dashboard* for cybersecurity teams.  

✅ *Example API Call:*
bash
curl --request GET --url 'https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/domains/example.com' --header 'x-apikey: YOUR_API_KEY'
