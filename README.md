# Real-Time Threat Intelligence & Risk Management Framework

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to develop a **Real-Time Threat Intelligence and Risk Management Framework** for **ShopSmart Solutions**, an e-commerce platform. The system will identify, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity risks using OSINT tools, automated risk assessment, and machine learning models. The framework aligns with **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and Risk Management Framework (RMF)** to enhance security posture.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Objectives
- **Threat Intelligence Gathering** â€“ Collect real-time threat data from OSINT APIs.
- **Real-Time Risk Monitoring** â€“ Continuously assess vulnerabilities and risks.
- **Automated Risk Assessment** â€“ Use GPT-4 AI to prioritize threats and suggest mitigation strategies.
- **NIST Compliance** â€“ Implement best practices in cybersecurity risk management.
